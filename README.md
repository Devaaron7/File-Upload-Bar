# File-Upload-Bar

I wrote this quick program to simulate a file upload progress bar. 

It takes a single file as it's input,  calculates its file size in Megabytes, then slowing increases the progress bar per second based on the current upload speed.

I created this to provide a visual timer for the work I do with a company, that currently doesn't have a progress bar for their file management system.

Usage - 

1. Drag & Drop the file you want to use onto the python file. ( You can also use the "send to" command if you place the python file in your SendTo folder.

2. Hit the Start Button to simulate the upload progress.
