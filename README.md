# File-Upload-Bar

I wrote this quick program to simulate a file upload progress bar. 

It takes a single file as it's input,  calculates its file size in Megabytes, then slowing increases the progress bar per second based on the current upload speed ( Hard coded into the program ).

I created this to provide a visual timer for the work I do with a company, that currently doesn't have a progress bar for their file management system.

Thank you for checking this out.
